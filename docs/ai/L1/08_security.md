> Trust boundaries, secret handling, and auth for the vision recipe.

## Trust boundaries

| Hop                             | Auth                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser → agent backend         | None in local dev (the `/api/*` rewrite is same-origin).                          |
| Agent backend → Agora cloud     | Token007, generated from `AGORA_APP_ID` + `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`.                |
| Agora cloud → OpenAI (via Agora)| Agora-managed by default (keyless). Optional `OPENAI_API_KEY` for BYO-key mode.  |

## Secret handling

- **Server-only secrets:** `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` lives only in `server/.env.local` and never reaches the browser. The browser receives a short-lived token, never the certificate.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional. When set, it stays in `server/.env.local` and is passed to the `OpenAI` vendor at session start — it never reaches the browser.
- `server/.env.local` is gitignored; `server/.env.example` ships placeholders only.
- Tokens (`generate_convo_ai_token`) expire after 3600s and are minted per `get_config` call for a concrete non-zero UID.

## CORS

The backend sets `CORSMiddleware` with `allow_origins=["*"]` — open by design for a local/dev recipe. **Lock this down to known origins before any production deployment.**

## Validation

- `Agent.__init__` raises `ValueError` if `AGORA_APP_ID` or `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` are missing.
- `Agent.start()` rejects empty `channel_name` and non-positive `agent_uid`/`user_uid` before issuing tokens or starting a session.
- Route errors are sanitized: `_log_route_error` logs only non-`None` context; SDK exceptions map to 400/500 without leaking internals to the client beyond the message.

## Camera and video privacy

- The local camera track is published into the Agora RTC channel only while the conversation is active.
- `ConversationComponent.tsx` explicitly stops and closes `localCameraTrack` on end-call and on unmount, turning off the camera indicator light.
- The browser camera preview (`LocalVideoTrack`) shows only locally; no video is ever sent to the backend.

## Deployment notes

- Set `AGENT_BACKEND_URL` only to a backend you control; the rewrite forwards browser requests there verbatim.
- The published Docker image is **backend-only** (`:8000`); it does not bundle secrets.
